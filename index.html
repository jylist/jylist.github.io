                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I was propelled into the medical device field when a family member received deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery to manage her Parkinson's Disease. It was pure magic; an incredible transformation. Since then, my dream has been to give other people second chances like I feel she was given.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a senior at Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo studying biomedical engineering with a concentration in mechanical design. I have interned with Abbot's Cardiac Rhythm Management division as a Mechanical Engineering Co-Op. There, I dove into validating designs and created fixtures to aid with manufacturing and quality control. Additionally, I have interned with Stryker's Medical division as an Advanced Quality Engineering intern and am currently interning with Stryker's Neurovascular division as an Advanced Technology & Innovation intern. During my time at Stryker, I have cultivated my engineering creativity while at the forefront of medical device innovation.</p>
                    <p>I have developed the following skills both in academic and leisure settings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solidworks</li>
                        <li>Creo</li>
                        <li>MATLAB</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Rhino</li>
                        <li>Autodesk Inventor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In my free time, you can find me training for my first half marathon and cultivating my newfound love for bullet journaling. I'm also a huge coffee enthusiast (probably due to growing up in Seattle) and I enjoy cooking.</p>
                    <p>My education as well as internships in industry have reinforced my desire to improve healthcare and the quality of life for patients. I am looking to pursue a patient-focused role in product development or field clinical engineering after I graduate in June 2019.</p>
